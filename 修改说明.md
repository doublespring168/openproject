### 安装 PostgreSQL

    1. brew update 
    2. brew install postgresql 
    
    icu4c is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
    because macOS provides libicucore.dylib (but nothing else).
    
    If you need to have icu4c first in your PATH run:
      echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
      echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    
    For compilers to find icu4c you may need to set:
      export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib"
      export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include"
    
    For pkg-config to find icu4c you may need to set:
      export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig"

    ==> Installing postgresql dependency: krb5
    ==> Pouring krb5-1.18.2.high_sierra.bottle.tar.gz
    ==> Caveats
    krb5 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
    because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
    parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.
    
    If you need to have krb5 first in your PATH run:
      echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/krb5/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
      echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/krb5/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    
    For compilers to find krb5 you may need to set:
      export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/krb5/lib"
      export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/krb5/include"
    
    For pkg-config to find krb5 you may need to set:
      export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/krb5/lib/pkgconfig"

    ==> Caveats
    To migrate existing data from a previous major version of PostgreSQL run:
      brew postgresql-upgrade-database
    
    To have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:
      brew services start postgresql
    Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
      pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
